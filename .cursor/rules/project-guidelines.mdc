# KASM-Pro: Browser-Based Learning Platform

## Project Overview
This platform provides browser-based virtual environments for learning technical skills like Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud infrastructure through guided challenges, terminal interaction, and automated validation.

## Architecture Guidelines

### Frontend Architecture
- Use React 18+ with functional components and hooks
- Split frontend into two applications:
  - Next.js 15+ for marketing site with SSR for SEO
  - Vite React for the application interface
- Implement TypeScript throughout with strict type checking
- Use Redux Toolkit for complex state management
- Build responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Implement xterm.js for terminal emulation
- Create shared component library between marketing and app

### Backend Architecture
- Follow microservices pattern with clear service boundaries
- Structure API gateway as entry point for all requests
- Implement JWT-based authentication (use HTTP-only, Secure cookies at the parent domain, e.g., .abclearning.com, for SSO between marketing (Next.js) and app (Vite React))
- Use environment manager service for container orchestration
- Create challenge service for content and validation
- Develop terminal service for WebSocket connections
- Support RESTful and WebSocket communication
- Provide /auth/status endpoint for lightweight authentication checks from the marketing site

### Database Design
- Store user data in PostgreSQL with normalized schema
- Use MongoDB for course content with flexible document structure
- Implement Redis for session management and caching
- Follow proper indexing and query optimization strategies

## Coding Standards

### General
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Document public methods and complex logic

### Frontend
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Create reusable, atomic components
- Follow container/presenter pattern
- Implement proper state management patterns
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for component styling

### Backend
- Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Implement proper validation for all inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow RESTful naming conventions
- Implement proper security headers and CORS

## Key Features Implementation

### Terminal Environment
- Implement full terminal emulation with proper escape sequences
- Support multiple simultaneous sessions
- Ensure <100ms input latency
- Implement command history and autocomplete
- Support file system operations

### Challenge System
- Create structured challenge data model
- Implement step-by-step validation
- Support different challenge types (guided, open)
- Provide hints and feedback mechanisms
- Track user progress and metrics

### Environment Management
- Support different environment templates
- Implement resource quotas and limitations
- Create environment provisioning workflow
- Manage environment lifecycle and cleanup
- Implement network isolation between environments

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize initial load time (<2s on broadband)
- Ensure terminal responsiveness (<100ms latency)
- Implement proper API caching strategies
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Support horizontal scaling for all services
