# KASM-Pro: A Browser-Based Learning Platform for Technical Skills

### Project Overview

This platform provides browser-based virtual environments for learning technical skills like Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud infrastructure. It features guided challenges, interactive terminals, and automated validation.

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18+, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, xterm.js for terminal emulation
- **Backend**: Microservices architecture with Node.js, Go, Python, Java
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes for orchestration, Docker containers for environments
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data, MongoDB for course content, Redis for sessions

### Coding Standards

- Follow established patterns in existing files
- Use TypeScript with strict typing for frontend and backend services
- Implement modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Adhere to RESTful principles for API endpoints
- Follow PEP 8 for Python, AirBnB style for JavaScript
- Write clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments
- Prioritize security best practices for container environments

### Key Features

- Browser-based terminal environments
- Challenge validation system
- Course management and progress tracking
- Environment provisioning and lifecycle management
- User authentication and role-based access

### Terminal Features

- Full terminal emulation via xterm.js
- WebSocket connections for real-time interaction
- Multiple terminal tabs
- File editing capabilities
- Command history and autocompletion

### Documentation Requirements

- Document all public APIs with JSDoc or equivalent
- Maintain technical specifications and implementation plans
- Create user documentation for key features

### Performance Requirements

- Terminal latency < 100ms
- API response time < 500ms
- Environment provisioning < 30 seconds
- Support for 500+ concurrent users
